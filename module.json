The powers often incentivize playstyles speci c to the cause the champion serves. Should the condition fail to be met, the champion becomes stunned 2 as the weight of their vow shatters against them in full force. Vows are magical abilities but cannot be dispelled or counteracted once in e ect, as the binding magic that enforces the tenets holds true divine power. Vows have no set duration, ending only at the end of a combat or until their condition is broken. While failing to uphold a vow does not immediately result in breaking your edicts and anathema, repeated failures may be considered the end of your service as a champion at GM discretion."
